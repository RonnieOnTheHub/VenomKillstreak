# VenomKillstreak
VenomKillstreak for VU, and adds on to [VU-Killstreak](https://github.com/Maxinger15/VU-Killstreak). The VenomKillstreak currently on works on Ziba Tower, and the server needs to be set to 60Hz for it to work properly.

## Maps
The Venom Killstreak mod currently only works on the list of maps below. Although the server is able to run on a different map with this mod active, the killstreak won't be able to spawn:
* Ziba Tower
* Scrapmetal
* Noshahr Canals

## Important
The Killstreak mod uses the [battlerecorder of OrfeasZ](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/battlerecorder). It is important to note that all recordings have been made in a 60Hz server, and currently battlerecorder does not suppourt playback recorded in 60Hz in a 120Hz or 30Hz server. So therefore it is <strong> important to run the server in 60Hz tick rate when using this mod!!</strong>.
